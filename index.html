  <meta name="description" content="BITMAIN ANTMINER S5 BATCH 5: The New Standard     A limited quantity of units will be sold in this batch. This is the last round of production for AntMiner S5, and Batch 5 will be the second-to-last batch of S5 units to be sold.     Generally, shipping out within 48 hours after full payment. But due to Tomb-sweeping Day, no shipping is arranged during April 4 to 6 and it will resume on April 7 after we&#39;re back.  For bulk purchasing (more than 500 units), please contact info@bitmaintech.com directly. Bulk buyers can pay an advance deposit of 37.5% of the full payment to reserve stock. This down payment is non-refundable.  Do you want to mine bitcoin? You should order S5 now and start to prepare your farm...  If you would like to pay via credit card, you may do so on our DHGate store.  Submitclick here  Note:   The price of bitcoin mining rigs has to be adjusted very often according to lots of factors, including the BTC/USD exchange rate, the network difficulty and its expectation. No refund request based on price change will be honored.     1) Chip Specifications: BM1384  The BM1384, Bitmain’s 3rd generation Bitcoin mining ASIC, provides significant improvements over our previous-gen BM1382 chip. Hashrate per mm2 at 0.75V has been increased by over 20% while reducing power consumption by 30%. This improvement is the result of months of hard work and development by Bitmain.      2) ANTMINER S5  Building upon the foundations laid by the S1 and S3, the AntMiner S5 retains the same small form factor of previous miners while using the more efficient BM1384 chip.             Specifications Hash Rate: 1155 GH/s ±5% Power Consumption: 590 W (at the wall) Power Efficiency: 0.51 J/GH (at the wall) Rated Voltage: 12V Dimensions: 298 mm x 137 mm x 155 mm Cooling: 1x 12038 fan Operating Conditions: 0 °C to 35 °C Certified By: FCC / CE Network Connection: Ethernet     Notes  1.   Power consumption figures may vary depending on PSU efficiency, ambient operating temperature, and the accuracy of the power meter.  2.   PSU: A power supply unit is not included, and you will need to provide an ATX PSU. There are 4 PCI-e connectors for +12V DC input and all four are required for use. Do not connect more than one PSU to the same hashing board.        A New Cooling Solution:  â      Heat is dissipated from the top of the chips, which are powered in a chain style design on the PCB. This PCB layout concentrates the heat onto one side of the board, making heat diffusion more efficient.     â      Two custom aluminium heat sinks draw all the heat to the middle of the miner, and allow for the use of just one fan to keep the S5 running cool and quiet.                                          Miner Experience Revolution – Manage your miner with ease  â      Monitor miner status  â       Pool configuration modification  â      Easy firmware upgrades  â      Share administrative privileges over the web        ">

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>
<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
